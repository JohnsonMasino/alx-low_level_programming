# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

>>LEARNING OBJECTIVES
0. What is a search algorithm
1. What is a linear search
2. What is a binary search
3. What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

>>REQUIREMENTS
0. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
1. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
2. All your files should end with a new line

6. No more than 5 functions per file
7. You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
8. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
9. The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
10. Don’t forget to push your header file
11. All your header files should be include guarded
